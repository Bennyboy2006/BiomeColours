# Minecraft Biome Colour Generator

---

This can be used to generate a datapack custom biome colours that you can apply to your world

This tool does not automatically add biomes to your world and only sets the colours not the full biome settings!
You must use worldedit or a similar tool to apply the biomes to an area.
